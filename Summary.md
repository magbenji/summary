# Introduction

Covid-19 (Coronovirus) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020. As of March 22, 169 countries/regions have reported at least one Covid-19 case; there have been 328,275 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 14,366 deaths.

The United States (US) reported its first case in [location] on [date]. On March 13, when Idaho reported its first case, a total of 2,179 cases in the US, and 145,193 cases globally had been reported. 

On March 18, universities throughout Idaho (Boise State, Idaho State, and University of Idaho) were asked to identify a team of researchers to provide a report that would help predict the expected number of people in Idaho anticipated to contract Covid-19, how many of these would require hospitalization, and likely effects of different interventions. 

On March 20, a small team of researchers met with TJ Bliss (Board of Education), Martijn van Beek (Idaho Department of Health and Welfare) [others important to mention, who outside of Idaho was on the call].  

# SEIR
Modelling Covid-19 is difficult given the number of unknowns in the equation. However, Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Removed (SEIR) models have been successfully used for other, similar, epidemics [cite]. The simplest SEIR model starts with a number of people susceptible to an illness. People who are susceptible become exposed at rate \(\beta\), those who are exposed become infectious at rate \(\sigma\), and those who are infectious recover at rate \(\gamma\). Once recovered, people can become susceptible again at rate xx.

The SEIR model was used to predict the number of cases in Idaho.

## Suggestions

I believe that a useful message for decision makers is that mass testing has the potential to help prevent spread and mitigate economic impacts.  In many communities in Idaho, the spread is sufficiently low that mass testing plus contact tracing has the potential to quelch local spread.  Without mass testing, community spread is inevitable and has devastating economic and health infrastructure consequences.
 
Mass testing is also required to accurately parameterize these models. Without it, there is a huge amount of uncertainty.  A useful strategy could be a (hopefully short) period of strong social distancing while mass testing is ramped up to large levels, followed by relaxation of social distancing measures (which hurt the economy) once we find out where we are.
