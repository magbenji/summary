The United States (US) reported its first case in [location] on [date]. On March 13, when Idaho reported its first case, a total of 2,179 cases in the US, and 145,193 cases globally had been reported. 

On March 18, universities throughout Idaho (Boise State, Idaho State, and University of Idaho) were asked to identify a team of researchers to provide a report that would help inform the next steps for the  Director of the Dept. of Health and Welfare.

I believe that a useful message for decision makers is that mass testing has the potential to help prevent spread and mitigate economic impacts.  In many communities in Idaho, the spread is sufficiently low that mass testing plus contact tracing has the potential to quelch local spread.  Without mass testing, community spread is inevitable and has devastating economic and health infrastructure consequences.
 
Mass testing is also required to accurately parameterize these models. Without it, there is a huge amount of uncertainty.  A useful strategy could be a (hopefully short) period of strong social distancing while mass testing is ramped up to large levels, followed by relaxation of social distancing measures (which hurt the economy) once we find out where we are.
