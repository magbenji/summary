I believe that a useful message for decision makers is that mass testing has the potential to help prevent spread and mitigate economic impacts.  In many communities in Idaho, the spread is sufficiently low that mass testing plus contact tracing has the potential to quelch local spread.  Without mass testing, community spread is inevitable and has devastating economic and health infrastructure consequences.
 
Mass testing is also required to accurately parameterize these models. Without it, there is a huge amount of uncertainty.  A useful strategy could be a (hopefully short) period of strong social distancing while mass testing is ramped up to large levels, followed by relaxation of social distancing measures (which hurt the economy) once we find out where we are.
